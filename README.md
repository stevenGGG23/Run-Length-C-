Purpose: The program compresses a string using run-length encoding. It counts consecutive identical characters and outputs the count followed by the character itself.
Functionality:
It prompts the user to input a line of text.
It checks if the input is empty and exits if so.
It iterates through the string, counting occurrences of each character.
When a new character is encountered, it prints the count and the character for the previous character, then resets the count.
After processing all characters, it outputs the count and character for the final group.
